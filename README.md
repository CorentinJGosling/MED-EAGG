# Medication's RCT Dataset Curated at Southampton University (MED-EAGG)

## Description of the database

The MED-EAGG project is a database of 151 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the efficacy/safety of pharmacological interventions for people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The collection of the data from these RCTS has been performed within the context of a network meta-analysis led by Prof Samuele Cortese (University of Southampton), on the behald of the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG).

## Aims of the database

The aim of the MED-EAGG projet is to make all the data we collected freely available for the community. We expect que le partage de ces données permettra de conduire rapidement de nouveaux projets ambitieux, qui permettront de mieux comprendre l'efficacity/la sécurité des médicaments pour le TDAH.
